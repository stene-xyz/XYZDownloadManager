# XYZDownloadManager
XYZDownloadManager is a tiny .NET 8 download manager that is basic by design. It was made to help me download large files over my spotty rural internet.

## Usage
Using XYZDownloadManager is very simple. Once the program is running, click `Add URL` and paste in the URL of the file you're trying to download. The URL of the file will remain in the download list until the download completes, at which point the file will be placed in the `%UserProfile%/Downloads` folder.  
Downloads will automatically resume on error or if the program is restarted.

XYZDownloadManager is released under the MIT license.
